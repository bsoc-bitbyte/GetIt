## ðŸ”° GETTING STARTED

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Frontend


### [![My Skills](https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=nodejs)](https://skills.thijs.gg)PREREQUISITS

The following software is required to be installed on your system:

* Node 16.x
* Npm 8.x

Type the following commands in the terminal to verify your node and npm versions

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### ![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-%23CB3837.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white) BASIC SETUP


#### Follow the steps mentioned below to setup the project locally on your computer

1. Fork the repository by clicking on `Fork` option on top right of the main repository.
2. Open Command Prompt/Terminal on your local computer.
3. Clone the forked repository by adding your own GitHub username in place of `<username>`.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/Getit/
```
4. Navigate to the Getit directory.

```bash
    cd Getit
```

5. Install all Getit dependencies. 

```bash
    npm install
```

6. Run the website locally.

```bash
    npm run dev
```



## Build for production guidelines
```
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Backend
- **Framework** - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- **Language** - Python 3.10
## Local Setup
Make sure you are using `python 3.10`. 	

- Change your working directory to `core`
- Create a new file in the same directory named: `.env` and copy all the content from `.env.template`
- Add a random string for `DJANGO_SECRET` or generate it online.
- Create a virtual environment: `$ python -m virtualenv .venv`
- Activate the virtual environment: `$ source .venv/bin/activate` (On windows: `> ./.venv/Scripts/activate`)
- Install the dependencies: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Make Migrations: `$ python manage.py makemigrations` (This commands generates migrations which would be used to update database schemas)
- Migrate the DB: `$ python manage.py migrate`
- Run server: `$ python manage.py runserver`

## Special Directories

You can create the following extra directories, some of which have special behaviors. Only `pages` is required; you can delete them if you don't want to use their functionality.

### `assets`

The assets directory contains your uncompiled assets such as Stylus or Sass files, images, or fonts.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/assets).

### `components`

The components directory contains your Vue.js components. Components make up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/components).

### `layouts`

Layouts are a great help when you want to change the look and feel of your Nuxt app, whether you want to include a sidebar or have distinct layouts for mobile and desktop.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/layouts).


### `pages`

This directory contains your application views and routes. Nuxt will read all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and setup Vue Router automatically.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/routing).

### `plugins`

The plugins directory contains JavaScript plugins that you want to run before instantiating the root Vue.js Application. This is the place to add Vue plugins and to inject functions or constants. Every time you need to use `Vue.use()`, you should create a file in `plugins/` and add its path to plugins in `nuxt.config.js`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/plugins).

### `static`

This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/static).

### `store`

This directory contains your Vuex store files. Creating a file in this directory automatically activates Vuex.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/store).
